## Installation

### Get started

* Generate your Twitter API keys through the [Twitter developer apps dashboard](https://apps.twitter.com/).
* Install Twitter Kit using instructions below.
* For extensive documentation, please see the official [documentation](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-kit-ios/wiki).
	
### Install using Cocoapods

To add Twitter Kit to your app, simply add `TwitterKit` to your Podfile.

```ruby
target 'MyApp' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'TwitterKit'
end
```

### Install using Carthage

To install Twitter Kit for iOS using Carthage, add the following lines to your Cartfile. For more information about how to set up Carthage and your Cartfile, see [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

```swift
binary "https://ton.twimg.com/syndication/twitterkit/ios/TwitterKit.json"
binary "https://ton.twimg.com/syndication/twitterkit/ios/TwitterCore.json"
```

After running `carthage update`, add `TwitterKit.framework`, `TwitterCore.framework` and `TwitterShareExtensionUI.framework` to the `Linked Frameworks and Binaries` section under General of your App target. In addition to that, make sure that when you are adding the copy-frameworks run script for Carthage that you add the following input paths: 

```swift
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/TwitterCore.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/TwitterKit.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/TwitterShareExtensionUI.framework
```

Make sure that the run script phase is after your Link Binaries with Libraries phase to prevent issues with properly archiving your iOS application.

### Preview Twitter Kit Features in the Demo App

Twitter Kit includes a demonstration app allowing you to preview features, and verify functionality. Create Twitter API keys as above, and then:

* To check out a demo app with features already built in, rename `DemoApp/Config.xcconfig.sample` to `DemoApp/Config.xcconfig` and populate the consumer key and secret.
* Run `DemoApp.xcworkspace` on Xcode to verify build.
